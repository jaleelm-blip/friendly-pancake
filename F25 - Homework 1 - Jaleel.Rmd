This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Part 1
```{r}
# (a) Read file Su_raw_matrix.txt into data frame su
su <- read.delim("su_raw_matrix.txt")

# (b) Find the mean of Liver_2.CEL in data frame su by Column Index
mean(su[,8])

# (b) Find the mean of Liver_2.CEL in data frame su by Column Name
mean(su$Liver_2.CEL)

# (b) Find the sd of Liver_2.CEL in data frame su by Column Index
sd(su[,8])

# (b) Find the sd of Liver_2.CEL in data frame su by Column Name
sd(su$Liver_2.CEL)

# (c) Find the average of each colum
colMeans(su)

# (c) Find the sum of each colum
colSums(su)
```







# Part 2
```{r}
# (2a) Generate 10000 numbers, mean=0, sigma=0.2
hista <- rnorm(10000, mean = 0, sd = 0.2)

# (2b) Generate 10000 numbers, mean=0, sigma=0.5

# Part 3
```{r}

# Density plots

# Density plots with semitransparent fill

# Part 3(f)
```{r}
# (3f) Read ”diabetes_train.csv” into a variable called diabetes
diabetes <- read.csv("diabetes_train.csv")

# Overlaid histograms
ggplot(diabetes, aes(x=mass, fill=class)) +

# Part 4
```{r}

# Read ”titanic.csv” into a variable called diabetes
passengers <- read.csv("titanic.csv")

#Remove rows with incomplete data; row count goes from 891 to 577
#Summarizes the data based on the column data types and content
passengers %>% drop_na() %>% summary()

#Filter for only the male passengers
passengers %>% filter(Sex == "male")

#Sorts the data from highest to lowest Fare
passengers %>% arrange(desc(Fare))

#Creates a new column which is equal to Parch plus SibSp in each row. It adds parents, children, siblings, and spouses
passengers %>% mutate(FamSize = Parch + SibSp)

#Groups the rows in the passengers data frame by Sex
#Creates a summary view of the data based on Sex; It has 2 rows and 3 columns, showing the average fair of each sex and the number of each sex who survived
passengers %>% group_by(Sex) %>% summarise(meanFare = mean(Fare), numSurv = sum(Survived))

# Part 5
```{r}

# Create a variable for the skin attribute in the diabetes data frame
skinPercentile <- diabetes$skin

# Calculate the 10th, 30th, 50th, and 60th percentiles of the skin attribute of the diabetes data
quantile(skinPercentile, c(0.10, 0.30, 0.50, 0.60))
